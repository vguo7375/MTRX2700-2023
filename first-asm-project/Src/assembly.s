@ this is the entry function called from the c file
assembly_function:
	@ Branch with link to set the clocks for the I/O and UART
	BL enable_peripheral_clocks

	@ Once the clocks are started, need to initialise the discovery board I/O
	BL initialise_discovery_board

	@ store the current light pattern (binary mask) in R4
	LDR R4, =0b01010101 @ load a pattern for the set of LEDs (every second one is on)

program_loop:

@ 	Look at the GPIOE offset ODR, display as hex, then as binary. Look at the manual page 239

	LDR R0, =GPIOE  @ load the address of the GPIOE register into R0
	STRB R4, [R0, #ODR + 1]   @ store this to the second byte of the ODR (bits 8-15)
	EOR R4, #0xFF	@ toggle all of the bits in the byte (1->0 0->1)

@ 	Look at the GPIOA offset IDR, display as hex, then as binary. Look at the manual page 239

@ 	task: read in the input button !
	LDR R0, =GPIOA	@ port for the input button
	LDR R1, [R0, IDR]

	@ If you run the code, the LEDs will blink too fast, so fast you cannot tell they
	@ are turning off and on. Uncomment the next line to make a delay

	BL delay_function

	B program_loop @ return to the program_loop label




@ think about how you could make a delay such that the LEDs blink at a certain frequency
delay_function:
	LDR R6, =0xf00ff

	@ we continue to subtract one from R6 while the result is not zero,
	@ then return to where the delay_function was called
not_finished_yet:
	SUBS R6, 0x01
	BNE not_finished_yet

	BX LR @ return from function call




@ enable the clocks for peripherals (GPIOA, C and E)
enable_peripheral_clocks:
	LDR R0, =RCC  @ load the address of the RCC address boundary (for enabling the IO clock)
	LDR R1, [R0, #AHBENR]  @ load the current value of the peripheral clock registers
	ORR R1, 1 << GPIOA_ENABLE | 1 << GPIOC_ENABLE | 1 << GPIOE_ENABLE  @ 21st bit is enable GPIOE clock, 17 is GPIOA clock
	STR R1, [R0, #AHBENR]  @ store the modified register back to the submodule
	BX LR @ return from function call





@ initialise the discovery board I/O (just outputs: inputs are selected by default)
initialise_discovery_board:
	LDR R0, =GPIOE 	@ load the address of the GPIOE register into R0
	LDR R1, =0x5555  @ load the binary value of 01 (OUTPUT) for each port in the upper two bytes
					 @ as 0x5555 = 01010101 01010101
	STRH R1, [R0, #MODER + 2]   @ store the new register values in the top half word representing
								@ the MODER settings for pe8-15
	BX LR @ return from function call
